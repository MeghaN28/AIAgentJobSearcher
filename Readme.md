This is a Self Project, used to Learn how to create AI Agent, Web Scraping.

Steps to start in the project
- Use Web Scraping Mechanism and Scrape jobs daily from the website
- Some websites which allow scraping are 
        remoteok.com	Static HTML, extremely easy to scrape, no bot protection
        weworkremotely.com	Static HTML, jobs listed in clean pages
        himalayas.app	Remote jobs, clean structure
        stackoverflow.com/jobs	(Archived now, but good for learning)
        simplyhired.com	Simpler than Indeed, but check ToS
        angel.co	Startups â€” easier to parse listings
- Indeed does not allow scraping so do not try it
- Next create ai agent and feed my data such as
    - Resume
    - Preferences for Job JSON Version
    - Scoring and matching functions
    - Match the scrap jobs with user preference and qualification

Training the model/agent with
Your resume (skills, experience)

Your job preferences (desired roles, locations, companies)

Later, you can add feedback to make the agent smarter.

Future scope:

How to expand to multiple students/job searchers
